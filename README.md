# Moncef Boujou

PhD in Computer Vision & Artificial Intelligence  
Applied AI / Computer Vision Engineer

I work on **video understanding and human-centered computer vision**, from research to real-world systems:
multi-camera tracking, person re-identification, trajectory analysis, and privacy-aware video analytics.
